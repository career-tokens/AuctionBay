# AuctionBay-Realtime Auction App
Its a MERN stack based project where other cool technologies like tailwind css (for quick styling), Redis (for session storage), EmailJS (for sending emails), Framer Motion (for cool animations) and many others have been used.
Its basically an app where people can sign up ( and then stay logged in or if logged out , can login back) and then either post their own products for listing or/and take part in the auctioning of any product . Whatever acceptable bid they will place will be shown to others watching the auction of that product in real time using the power of sockets (plus room based logic where each product is acting as a room where certain people are joining). 
You can sign out anytime. Redis is used to maintain the session for a logged in user.
